## Consumer-Facing Non-Conversational Experiences

Build smart enhancements that proactively assist users within existing workflows. We're looking for solutions that inject intelligence without requiring explicit conversation.

Examples include:

- Solution suggestions from a knowledge base during support ticket submission
- Fashion "look" creation from a curated index
- PC building with knowledge of compatibility of different components

The key is showing how contextual data retrieval enhances user experience without requiring back-and-forth dialogue.
